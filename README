pars
====

A gem that provides parse routines for various linux file formats.  A lot 
of config and backup file formats on linux can be parsed into simple data
structures.  The goal here is to write real grammars for things like lvmbackups
and xenstore-ls output into hashes we can work with easily in Ruby.  We're
using treetop.
